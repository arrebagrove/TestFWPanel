This is a proof of concept to show how **AdaptiveTriggers** can be used to extend the behavior of **FluidWrapPanel** to create a dynamic layout like in the image displayed below.

In this example, the FluidWrapPanel contains 12 children. Based on the width of the window, the number of rows and columns in the layout varies between 6x2, 4x3 and 3x4.
